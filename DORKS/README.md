### Introduction to Dorks

info: The query [info:] will present some information that Google has about that web page. For instance, [info:www-google.com] will show information about the Google homepage. Note there can be no space between the “info:” and the web page url.

link: The query [link:] will list webpages that have links to the specified webpage. For instance, [link:www-google.com] will list web pages that have links pointing to the Google Homepage 
site: If you include [site:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to those websites in the given domain.

For instance, [help site:www-google.com] will find pages about help within www-google.com. [help site:com] will find pages about help within .com urls. Note there can be no space between the “site:” and the domain.

inurl: If you include [inurl:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to documents containing that word in the url. For instance, [inurl:google search] will return documents that mention the word “google” in their url, and mention the word “search” anywhere in the document (url or no).

The Google dorks list is a never-ending one and the list keeps on growing based on the new technologies and the vulnerabilities.
